<!-- AboutUS -->
    <string name="aboutUs">Good World Games os a pioneer of the Gaming for good movement.
        We allow playes to make a difference while having fun.
        We partner with non-profits to support causes through our games.\n\n
        Games in and of themselves are great, but games that also do good are awesome.
        We had the crazy idea that maybe games are more than about having fun and entrtaining your brain for a few minutes here, a few hours there.\n\n
        What if games can change the way people behave in their lives? What if, through the power of games, we can leverage our collective wealth, intelligance, and energy to help solve hard problems?
         Join our movement!\n\n
